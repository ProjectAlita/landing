Different models have varying capabilities and performance characteristics. Common options include:<ul> <li><code>gpt-4o</code>: A highly capable and advanced model known for its nuanced understanding and high-quality output.</li> <li><code>gpt-35-turbo</code>: A more cost-effective and faster model that still provides excellent performance for a wide range of tasks. The choice of model can significantly impact the quality, speed, and cost of your prompt executions.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Temperature: This parameter controls the randomness and creativity of the AI's responses. It is a value between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.<ul> <li>A lower temperature (closer to 0) results in more predictable and focused responses. The AI will tend to choose the most likely next words, making the output more deterministic and consistent. This is suitable for tasks requiring factual accuracy and precision.</li> <li>A higher temperature (closer to 1 or above) introduces more randomness, leading to more creative and unexpected outputs. The AI will consider less probable words, potentially generating more diverse and novel responses. This is useful for brainstorming, creative writing, or when exploring different possibilities.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Top P (0-1): Also known as nucleus sampling, Top P offers another way to control the randomness of the output. It works by considering the smallest set of most probable tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the value of P.<ul> <li>A lower Top P value (e.g., 0.1) means the AI will only consider a very small, highly probable set of tokens, leading to more focused and deterministic responses.</li> <li>A higher Top P value (e.g., 0.9) allows the AI to consider a broader range of tokens, including less probable ones, resulting in more varied and potentially creative outputs. Top P provides a more dynamic way to control randomness compared to Temperature, as the number of tokens considered can vary depending on the context.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Top K: This parameter limits the AI's token selection to the K most likely tokens at each step of the generation process.<ul> <li>A lower Top K value (e.g., 10) restricts the AI to choosing from only the top 10 most probable tokens, leading to more focused and predictable responses.</li> <li>A higher Top K value (e.g., 100) allows the AI to choose from a wider range of likely tokens, potentially increasing the diversity and surprise in the output. Top K is useful for controlling the vocabulary and ensuring the AI stays within a certain range of likely words.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Maximum Completion Tokens: This setting defines the maximum length of the AI's generated response, measured in tokens. Tokens can be roughly thought of as parts of words.<ul> <li>Setting a lower value for Maximum Completion Tokens will result in shorter, more concise responses. This is useful when you need brief answers or summaries.</li> <li>Setting a higher value allows the AI to generate longer, more detailed responses.
